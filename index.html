            <h1>Daheen Lee</h1>
            <p>I'm an iOS app developer who grew an app from zero to over 80,000 users. I strongly believe that being an active app user myself makes me a better iOS engineer. <br>As a versatile problem solver, I'm adept at tackling challenges with a blend of iOS expertise and automation, including CI/CD pipelines, to deliver seamless, efficient solutions.</p>
