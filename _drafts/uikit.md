The UIKit and Foundation frameworks provide many of the basic types that you use to define your appâ€™s model objects. UIKit provides a [`UIDocument`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidocument) object for organizing the data structures that belong in a disk-based file. The Foundation framework defines basic objects representing strings, numbers, arrays, and other data types. The [Swift Standard Library](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/swift_standard_library) provides many of the same types available in the Foundation framework.
